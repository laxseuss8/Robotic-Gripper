# Robotic-Gripper
This automated sorting system used an Arduino UNO microcontroller, a robotic arm, a battery, a webcam, and a laptop for image classification through transfer learning models.  

The files are separated based on training transfer learning models deployed in computer, a GUI as user interface, and output for Robotic Gripper using Arduino.

The tranfer learning models are trained. The VGG-16, InceptionV3, and GoogleNet were the models were chosen during training phase. The models did undergo test and validation to ensure that model is fit to the dataset. 

The VGG-16 have shown the highest accuracy among the 3 models trained, therefore it was employed by the proponents in the project.

See the "Brochure" file to understand further the worked project.
